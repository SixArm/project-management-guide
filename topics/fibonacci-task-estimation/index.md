# Fibonacci task estimation

Fibonacci task estimation is a technique used in Agile project management to estimate the relative size or effort of tasks or user stories. It is based on the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on. In Fibonacci task estimation, team members assign Fibonacci numbers to tasks based on their perceived complexity or effort required. The higher the Fibonacci number, the larger or more complex the task is considered.

Fibonacci task estimation promotes a relative sizing, and is based on the principle that as tasks increase in complexity, the effort required tends to grow in a nonlinear manner.

Here's how it typically works:

1. The project team reviews the list of tasks or user stories to be estimated.

2. Each team member privately assigns a Fibonacci number to each task, representing their estimate of its size or complexity. For example, a team member might assign a 5 to one task and an 8 to another.

3. Once everyone has assigned their estimates, the team discusses and compares their assigned numbers.

4. If there is a consensus among team members, the assigned number becomes the estimated size for that task.

5. If there is a significant difference in assigned numbers, the team engages in a discussion to understand the underlying reasons for the variations and reach a consensus. This may involve clarifying requirements, breaking down tasks further, or addressing any uncertainties.

6. The process is repeated for all the tasks until estimates are assigned to each one.
