# Project management life cycle (PMLC)

The project management life cycle (PMLC) is a framework that outlines the stages or phases through which a project progresses from initiation to closure. It provides a structured approach for managing projects and helps ensure that key activities and deliverables are completed in a logical sequence.

Key phasesâ€¦

1. Initiation: Identify the need for the project. Determine the project's objectives, scope, and feasibility. Define the project's goals, conduct initial assessments, and obtain approval to proceed.

2. Planning: Develop a detailed plan to guide the project's execution. Definine project requirements, identify tasks, estimate resources, create schedules, develop budgets, and outline risk management strategies.

3. Execution: Do the project activities according to plan. Communicate and coordinate with stakeholders. Monitor progress to ensure the project stays on track, in terms of scope, schedule, cost, and quality. Make necessary adjustments as required.

4. Closure: Complete final deliverables, conduct project reviews and evaluations, document lessons learned, and obtain formal project acceptance. Transition the project's outcomes to the appropriate stakeholders, archive documentation, and release resources.

It's important to note that the project management life cycle is iterative and dynamic. Allow for feedback loops, adjustments, and continuous improvement throughout the project. Effective project management requires adapting the life cycle to meet the unique needs and requirements of the project.
