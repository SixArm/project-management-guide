# Outputs versus outcomes (OVO)

Outputs and outcomes are two related but distinct concepts in project management.

* Outputs refer to the tangible or intangible products, services, or deliverables that result from a project. They are the immediate or direct results of project activities, such as a new software application, a report, or a physical infrastructure.

* Outcomes refer to the changes, benefits, or impacts that result from the project outputs. They are the longer-term or indirect results of project activities, such as improved customer satisfaction, increased revenue, or enhanced social well-being.

Here are some key differences between outputs and outcomes:

* Focus: Outputs focus on the products or services that a project produces. Outcomes focus on the changes or benefits that result from those outputs.

* Timeframe: Outputs are typically measured during or immediately after a project. Outcomes are typically measured over a longer period of time after the project is completed.

* Measurability: Outputs are typically easier to measure than outcomes since they are tangible and visible. Outcomes may require more sophisticated methods of evaluation, such as surveys or assessments.

* Value: Outputs may have value in and of themselves. Outcomes create value by delivering benefits and achieving goals.

* Importance: Both outputs and outcomes are important, but outcomes are ultimately what matter most, as they represent the long-term benefits and impacts of a project.
