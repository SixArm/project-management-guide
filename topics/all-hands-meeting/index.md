# All-hands meeting

An all-hands meeting, also known as a town hall meeting or company-wide meeting, is a gathering that brings together all employees of an organization, from various levels and departments, to communicate important information, provide updates, foster transparency, and promote alignment across the company.

By gathering all employees together, all-hands meetings promote a sense of unity, trust, and alignment across the organization. They help employees understand how their individual roles contribute to the overall success of the company.

All-hands meetings can shape company culture. They provide an opportunity to celebrate successes, recognize employee achievements, reinforce core values, showcase employee accomplishments, promote teamwork, and emphasize the organization's vision, mission, and values.

All-hands meetings often include a Q&A session, allowing employees to ask questions, leading to a dialogue between leadership and employees. This helps employee engagement and continuous improvement.

All-hands meetings can include team-building activities, icebreakers, or breakout sessions that allow employees to connect, collaborate, and build relationships with colleagues they may not typically interact with in their daily work.

With the rise of remote and distributed workforces, all-hands meetings take on even greater significance. These meetings provide a platform to connect employees across different locations, time zones, and even different countries.

All-hands meetings are part of an ongoing communication strategy. Following the meeting, it is crucial to provide follow-up communication, such as meeting summaries, action items, and next steps. This ensures that the information shared and discussed during the meeting is reinforced, and employees have a clear understanding going forward.
