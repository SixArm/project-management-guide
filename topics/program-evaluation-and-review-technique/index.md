# Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)

Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) is a project management tool used to estimate the time required to complete a project. PERT is based on the Critical Path Method (CPM), which identifies the longest path of a project. PERT uses a probabilistic approach to estimate project completion time, taking into account the uncertainty and variability of individual tasks.

**Steps:**

1. **Identify tasks:** Break down the project into individual tasks or activities.

2. **Determine sequences:**: Specify the order in which the tasks need to be completed.

3. **Estimate durations**: Estimate the time required to complete each task.

4. **Analyze critical paths**: Discover the sequence of tasks that must be completed on time to ensure the project is completed on time.

5. **Review results:** Review the project timeline, and identifying any potential bottlenecks or delays.

PERT uses three time estimates for each task: optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic. PERT calculates the expected duration of each task and the project. PERT takes into account dependencies between tasks, and the probability of completing each task on time.

PERT enables project managers to identify potential delays, estimate the probability of completing the project on time, and allocate resources more effectively. However, PERT can be complex to implement, and it relies heavily on accurate time estimates for each task.
