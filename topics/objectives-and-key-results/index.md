# Objectives and Key Results

Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) is a goal-setting framework that helps organizations align goals with outcomes.

**General steps:**

1. **Define Objectives:** Objectives are the high-level goals that a company wants to achieve. Objectives should be challenging but achievable.

2. **Define Key Results:** Key results are  specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, timely (SMART) outcomes that a company wants to achieve in order to reach its objectives.

3. **Track Metrics:** Metrics are the quantitative measures that are used to track progress towards achieving the key results. Metrics should be clear and relevant to the objectives and key results, and should be easy to track and report.

4. **Create Alignment:** OKRs are most effective when they are aligned throughout the organization. This means that every employee should have OKRs that are aligned with the company's overall objectives and key results. This enables better collaboration.

5. **Review Quarterly:** OKRs must be reviewed regularly, for tracking progress, and for adjusting as necessary.

**Benefits include:**

* **Focus:** OKRs help companies to focus on their most important goals and outcomes.

* **Alignment:** OKRs ensure that everyone in the organization is working towards the same goals.

* **Accountability:** OKRs help everyone become responsible for achieving their own OKRs.

* **Agility:** OKRs allow companies to be agile and adapt quickly to changing circumstances.
