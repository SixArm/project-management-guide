# Pizza team

In the context of startups, a pizza team is a small group of individuals that can fit in a single room and can be fed with two pizzas. The idea behind this concept is that a smaller team size can lead to better communication, collaboration, and decision-making, thereby increasing productivity and efficiency.

The term "pizza team" was coined by Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, who believed that if a team was too large to be fed with two pizzas, then it was too large to be effective. The concept has since been adopted by many startups and has become a popular way of organizing teams.

In a pizza team, everyone knows what everyone else is working on, and communication is direct and effective. This helps to eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy and increase the speed of decision-making. Since the team is small, it is also easier to maintain a sense of camaraderie and work towards a common goal.

However, it is important to note that the pizza team concept may not work for every startup. Depending on the nature of the business, a larger team may be necessary to achieve the company's goals. Additionally, a pizza team may struggle with scaling up if the company experiences rapid growth.
