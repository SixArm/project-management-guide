# Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)

Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) are metrics that assesses the level of risk of processes. KRIs provide an early warning of potential risks and help to identify trends that could have a negative impact on the organization. KRIs are usually specific to an organization or industry and are used to monitor and manage risks on an ongoing basis.

KRIs are used to measure risks in a way that is easy to understand and communicate. They are typically used by senior management to monitor the overall risk profile of an organization. KRIs can be used to measure both financial and non-financial risks, such as operational, strategic, regulatory, and reputational risks.

There are several characteristics of good KRIs, including:

* They are measurable and quantifiable: KRIs should be easy to measure and provide a clear indication of the level of risk.

* They are specific: KRIs should be tailored to the organization or industry they are being used for, and should measure risks that are relevant to the organization.

* They are actionable: KRIs should provide insight into how risks can be mitigated, so that action can be taken to reduce the level of risk.

* They are timely: KRIs should be monitored on an ongoing basis, so that early warning signs of potential risks can be identified and addressed in a timely manner.

* They are aligned with business objectives: KRIs should be aligned with the overall objectives of the organization, so that risks can be managed in a way that supports the organization's goals.

KRIs are often used in conjunction with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which measure the performance of an organization against specific goals or targets. Together, KRIs and KPIs provide a comprehensive view of an organization's performance, risk, and health.
