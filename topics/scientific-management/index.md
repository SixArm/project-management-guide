# Scientific management

Scientific management is a management theory developed by Frederick Winslow Taylor in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Taylor believed that organizations could achieve increased productivity and efficiency by applying scientific principles to the study of work processes and by carefully managing the tasks performed by workers. Scientific management had a significant impact on industrial practices, particularly in manufacturing and production environments.

**Key aspects:**

Division of labor: Break down work tasks into small, specialized, and repetitive tasks. Allow workers to focus on specific aspects of the job, leading to increased efficiency and productivity.

Studies: Conduct time and motion studies to identify efficient ways to perform tasks. Eliminate unnecessary movements, reduce wasteful actions, and standardize work processes to optimize productivity.

Scientific selection and training: Select and train workers based on their aptitude and ability to perform specific tasks, who possess the capabilities to ensure maximum productivity.

Clear instructions and standardization: Provide clear and detailed instructions to workers. Standardize work methods and processes to ensure consistency and eliminate inefficiencies.

Incentives and rewards: Provide financial incentives to motivate workers. Taylor proposed a piece-rate payment system where workers were rewarded based on their output or performance.
