# TEAM FOCUS

"TEAM FOCUS" is a framework developed by the global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company to help organizations improve their team effectiveness.

**TEAM is interpersonal:**

* **Talk:** Establish very effective channels of communication.

* **Evaluate:** Assess performance and adapt accordingly.

* **Assist:** Help each other. Strategic leverage of unique capabilities is an underlying component of all "special forces" organizations.

* **Motivate:** Pay close attention to individuals' drivers. This will go a long way.

**FOCUS is analytical:**

* **Frame:** framing the problem, before you begin, involves identifying the key question that you are studying, drawing issue trees for potential investigation, and developing hypotheses for testing during the project.

* **Organize:** a boring but necessary step in preparing the team for efficient problem solving. Organize around content hypotheses with the end in mind.

* **Collect:** Find relevant data, and avoid overcollection of data that are not useful.

* **Understand:** Evaluate data for potential contribution to proving or disproving hypotheses. Ask "so what?"

* **Synthesize:** Turn data into a compelling story. Here is where the well-known "pyramid principle" related to organizing a written report or slide deck comes into play.
