# Class diagram

A class diagram represents the structure of a system in terms of its classes and their relationships. It is used to describe the objects, attributes, methods, and relationships within a system, and to provide a visual representation of the system's structure.

Main componentsâ€¦

Class: A class is a template for creating objects in a system. It defines the attributes and methods of the objects and provides a structure for organizing the data and behavior of the system. It is represented as a rectangle with the class name at the top.

Object: An object is an instance of a class in a system. It it has its own set of attributes and methods. It is represented as rectangles with the object name at the top.

Attributes: Attributes are the properties of an object that describe its state. They represent the data that an object contains and define the characteristics of the object. Attributes are represented as ovals attached to a class or object.

Methods: Methods are the behaviors of an object that define what it can do. They represent the operations that an object can perform and define how it interacts with other objects. Methods are represented as rectangles attached to a class or object.

Relationships: Relationships represent the connections between classes and objects in a system. The most common relationships in a class diagram are association, aggregation, and composition.

Association: A relationship between two classes, such as "is composed of", or "contains", or "has a", etc. It is represented by a line connecting the two classes.
