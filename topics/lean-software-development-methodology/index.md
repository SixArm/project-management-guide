# Lean software development methodology

Lean software development is a methodology for software development that emphasizes the importance of delivering value to the customer, minimizing waste, and continuous improvement. It is inspired by lean manufacturing, developed by Toyota in the 1940s and 1950s.

Key principlesâ€¦

1. Deliver value: The primary focus of lean software development is delivering value to the customer. This means that the team should prioritize features and functionality that directly contribute to the customer's needs.

2. Eliminate waste: Lean software development aims to eliminate waste by reducing unnecessary features, streamlining processes, and minimizing idle time.

3. Improve continuously: Lean software development emphasizes continuous improvement through feedback, experimentation, and learning. The team should regularly reflect on their processes and identify opportunities for improvement.

4. Empower the team: Lean software development encourages team members to take ownership of their work and make decisions based on their expertise.

5. Build quality in: Lean software development emphasizes building quality into the development process from the beginning. This means quality assurance should be integrated into the development process.

Benefits of lean software development include faster time-to-market, greater efficiency, improved quality, greater customer satisfaction, and higher employee engagement.
