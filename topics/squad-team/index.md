# Squad team

A squad team in a startup refers to a group of cross-functional individuals who work together to achieve a specific goal or mission. It is a concept popularized by Spotify, a music streaming company that revolutionized the way organizations work by introducing agile practices to their development process. In a squad team, individuals from different functions such as design, engineering, marketing, and product come together to work towards a common objective.

**Key aspects:**

* **Self-organizing:** The squad team is responsible for its own work and how it operates. The team members collaborate and make decisions on their own, rather than relying on a hierarchical structure.

* **Cross-functional:** A squad team consists of individuals from different functions, each bringing their unique skill set to the table. This enables the team to be more efficient and effective in achieving its objectives.

* **Autonomous:** The squad team is empowered to make decisions and take actions independently, without the need for approval from higher-ups.

* **Goal-oriented:** The squad team works towards a specific objective or mission, which is aligned with the company's overall strategy.

* **Agile:** The squad team follows an agile methodology, which emphasizes rapid iteration, continuous improvement, and a focus on delivering value to customers.

Squad teams are often used in startups and other fast-paced, dynamic environments, where agility and speed are essential to success. They enable organizations to quickly adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs, and to stay ahead of the competition.
