# Scope

In project management, scope refers to the specific deliverables, objectives, tasks, and boundaries of a project. It defines the work that needs to be done to accomplish the project's goals and objectives. The scope outlines the project's boundaries by specifying what is included and what is not included.

Project managers use various techniques like scope statements, work breakdown structures (WBS), and change control processes to define, manage, and control project scope throughout its lifecycle.

Key aspectsâ€¦

Project Objectives: The scope statement identifies the project's objectives, which describe the desired outcomes or results that the project aims to achieve. Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

Deliverables: Scope defines the tangible or intangible products, services, or results that will be delivered by the project. Deliverables are specific and measurable and provide a clear understanding of what will be produced or accomplished.

Requirements: The scope statement outlines the functional and non-functional requirements that need to be met by the project. These requirements specify the features, functionalities, and characteristics that the project deliverables must possess to satisfy the stakeholders' needs and expectations.

Assumptions and Constraints: Scope includes any assumptions made during the project planning process and identifies any constraints that may impact the project's execution. Assumptions are factors or conditions believed to be true but are not yet proven, while constraints are factors that limit the project's options or resources.
