# Five Whys analysis

Five Whys analysis is a problem-solving technique that is often used in the manufacturing and engineering industries, but can be applied to any field. It involves asking the question "why" five times to identify the root cause of a problem.

Five Whys analysis works by drilling down from the symptoms of a problem to its underlying causes, identifying the root cause of the problem and enabling the development of an effective solution. It can be used as a standalone technique or as part of a broader problem-solving approach, such as root cause analysis.

Five Whys analysis is typically conducted by a team of people who work together to ask and answer the "why" questions. The team starts with the symptom of the problem and asks why it is occurring. The answer to the first "why" question is then used to ask a second "why" question, and so on, until the root cause of the problem is identified.

It is important to note that Five Whys analysis should not stop at the obvious answers to the "why" questions. Instead, the team should dig deeper to get to the root cause of the problem, which may be less obvious or hidden behind other issues.

Once the root cause of the problem has been identified, the team can then develop and implement a solution that addresses the underlying cause rather than just the symptoms. This approach can lead to more effective problem solving, as it prevents the same problem from recurring in the future.
