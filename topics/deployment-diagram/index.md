# Deployment diagram

A deployment diagram in Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of diagram that shows the configuration and arrangement of runtime processing nodes, components, and artifacts in a distributed system. It is used to illustrate how software components are deployed on hardware infrastructure and how they interact with one another.

Deployment diagrams depict the physical architecture of a system and are used to model the system's deployment view. They typically show the relationship between hardware nodes, such as servers or workstations, and software components, such as web applications or databases. The components are represented by rectangular boxes, while the nodes are represented by either a cube or a sphere, depending on the type of node.

Deployment diagrams can be used to model different levels of abstraction, from a high-level overview of the system to a detailed description of a particular component's deployment. They can also show the configuration of the physical resources that support the software components and the connections between them.

**Typical elements:**:

* **Node:** A physical device or software execution environment, such as a server or a workstation.

* **Component:** A modular part of the software system that provides specific functionality.

* **Artifact:** A physical piece of data that is used or produced by a software component, such as a database or a file.

* **Association:** A connection between a node and a component or between two nodes.

* **Dependency:** A relationship in which a component depends on another component or artifact.
