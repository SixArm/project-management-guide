# After-Action Report (AAR)

An after-action report (AAR) is a structured review and analysis of a specific event or project that is conducted after it has been completed. The purpose of an AAR is to identify what worked well, what did not work well, and to recommend improvements for the future. AARs are commonly used in the military, emergency services, and in businesses to evaluate the effectiveness of training, exercises, and operations.

An AAR typically involves gathering data and feedback from all relevant stakeholders, including participants, leaders, and observers. The data may include observations, notes, and recordings of the event, as well as interviews and surveys with participants and stakeholders. The data is analyzed to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis) related to the event or project.

**Key aspects:**

* **Objectives**: A clear statement of the purpose and goals of the AAR.

* **Participants**: A list of the participants and stakeholders involved in the event or project.

* **Observations**: A detailed summary of what happened during the event or project, including any issues, challenges, or successes.

* **Analysis**: An in-depth analysis of the data collected, including a SWOT analysis and identification of the root causes of any issues or challenges.

* **Recommendations**: Actionable recommendations for improvement based on the findings of the analysis.

* **Implementation Plan**: A detailed plan for implementing the recommendations, including timelines, responsibilities, and resources needed.
