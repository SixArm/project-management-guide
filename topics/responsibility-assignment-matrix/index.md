# Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM)

A Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM) is a tool used in project management to define and clarify the roles and responsibilities of team members for specific tasks or activities. The matrix is typically displayed in a grid format, with team members listed along the top and the tasks or activities listed along the side.

Each cell in the matrix represents a specific task or activity and the roles and responsibilities associated with it. The matrix uses symbols or letters to indicate the level of responsibility for each team member for each task or activity.

**Common variations:**

* **RACI matrix:** Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed.

* **RACIO matrix:** Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed, Omitted.

* **PARIS matrix:** Participate, Approve, Responsible, Input, Sign-off.

The RAM is a useful tool for ensuring that everyone on the team understands their roles and responsibilities and is clear on what they need to do to contribute to the project's success. It can also help to identify any gaps or overlaps in responsibilities and ensure that all tasks are covered.

In addition to creating a RAM, it's important to communicate it to all stakeholders, and to review it regularly to ensure that it is updated as needed.
