# SMART criteria

SMART criteria is a popular framework used for goal setting and project planning. It is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timely. The SMART criteria help to ensure that goals and objectives are well-defined and achievable.

* **Specific:** The goal should be clearly defined and specific. This means that it should answer the questions of who, what, when, where, and why. A specific goal is one that is clearly defined and leaves no room for ambiguity.

* **Measurable:** The goal should be measurable so that you can track your progress and determine when you have achieved it. Measurable goals have specific metrics that can be used to evaluate progress and determine success.

* **Achievable:** The goal should be achievable and realistic. It should be something that you can realistically accomplish within a given timeframe, with the resources and skills available to you. This element is important because setting unrealistic goals can lead to disappointment and discouragement.

* **Relevant:** The goal should be relevant and aligned with your overall objectives. It should be something that is important to you or your organization, and that will contribute to your overall success.

* **Timely:** The goal should have be occurring at a favorable/useful/opportune time, and with a specific timeframe for completion. This helps with planning and accountability, and ensures that you stay focused and motivated.

Using SMART criteria helps ensure that your goals and objectives are well-defined, and helps enable clearer communication and collaboration among teammates.
