# Scope

In project management, scope refers to the specific deliverables, objectives, tasks, and boundaries of a project. It defines the work that needs to be done to accomplish the project's goals and objectives. The scope outlines the project's boundaries by specifying what is included and what is not included.

Project managers use various techniques like scope statements, work breakdown structures (WBS), and change control processes to define, manage, and control project scope throughout its lifecycle.

**Key aspects:**

* **Project Objectives:** Identify the project's objectives. Describe the desired outcomes or results that the project aims to achieve. Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timely (SMART).

* **Deliverables:** Define the tangible or intangible products, services, or results that will be delivered by the project. Provide a clear understanding of what will be produced or accomplished. Deliverables are specific and measurable.

* **Requirements:** Explain the functional and non-functional requirements that need to be met by the project. Specify the features, functionalities, and characteristics that the project must possess to satisfy the stakeholders' needs and expectations.

* **Limitations:** Detail any limitations, such as assumptions or constraints, made during the project planning process. Assumptions are factors or conditions believed to be true but are not yet proven. Constraints are factors that limit the project's options or resources.
