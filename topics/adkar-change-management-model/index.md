# ADKAR change management model

ADKAR is a change management model that helps individuals and organizations to manage change effectively. Developed by Prosci, a leading provider of change management research and training, ADKAR stands for Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, and Reinforcement. Each of these elements represents a key step in the change management process, and the ADKAR model provides a framework for understanding and managing change.

Awareness: refers to the need to create awareness of the need for change. This involves communicating the reasons for the change and the impact it will have on individuals and the organization as a whole. It is essential that individuals understand why the change is necessary and what it will mean for them personally.

Desire: refers to the need to create a desire to participate in the change process. This involves creating a compelling vision for the future that inspires individuals to want to be a part of the change. It also involves addressing any concerns or resistance to the change that individuals may have.

Knowledge: refers to the need to provide individuals with the knowledge and skills they need to make the change. This involves providing training and support to help individuals develop the new skills and knowledge required to succeed in the new environment.

Ability: refers to the need to provide individuals with the resources they need to make the change. This may involve providing access to tools, technology, or other resources that will help individuals to perform their roles effectively in the new environment.

Reinforcement: refers to the need to reinforce the change to ensure that it becomes a permanent part of the organization's culture. This involves celebrating successes, recognizing individuals for their contributions, and creating a culture that supports and reinforces the change.
