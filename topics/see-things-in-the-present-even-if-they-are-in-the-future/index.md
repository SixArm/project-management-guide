# See things in the present, even if they are in the future

"See things in the present, even if they are in the future" is a quotation by Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle Corporation, implies the importance of visionary thinking and strategic planning. Ellison is known for his visionary leadership style, and this quote reflects his belief that great leaders have the ability to anticipate and shape the future by acting in the present.

The quote suggests that successful leaders should have a clear understanding of the present realities, trends, and challenges, while also having the vision and foresight to anticipate future changes and opportunities. By "seeing things in the present," leaders can identify the current strengths and weaknesses of their organization, as well as the external factors that may impact their industry or market.

The quote also suggests the importance of having a mindset that is not limited by the current realities or constraints. By seeing things in the present, even if they are in the future, leaders can envision a future that is not limited by the current state of affairs. This requires leaders to be innovative, open-minded, willing to challenge the status quo, willing to take risks, and committed to making bold moves that will position their organization for success in the future.

The quote implies that leaders should be proactive in shaping their future rather than being reactive to it. By anticipating future trends and possibilities, leaders can position their organizations to take advantage of new opportunities or navigate potential challenges more effectively.
