# Descriptive statistics

Descriptive statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with the summary and analysis of a set of data. Its goal is to describe and summarize the main features of a dataset, such as its central tendency, dispersion, and shape. Descriptive statistics is used to analyze and present data in a meaningful way, making it easier to understand and draw conclusions from the data.

Descriptive statistics can be divided into two main categories: measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion. Measures of central tendency provide information about the typical or central value of a dataset, while measures of dispersion provide information about the variability or spread of the data.

* **Measures of central tendency** include the mean, median, and mode. The mean is the average value of a dataset and is calculated by adding all the values together and dividing by the number of observations. The median is the middle value in a dataset, and the mode is the most frequent value in a dataset.

* **Measures of dispersion** include the range, variance, and standard deviation. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. The variance measures how much the individual observations in a dataset deviate from the mean, while the standard deviation is the square root of the variance and measures the spread of the data around the mean.

Descriptive statistics can be used to summarize and analyze data in many different fields, such as business, finance, social sciences, and medicine. For example, in finance, descriptive statistics can be used to analyze stock prices and returns, while in medicine, it can be used to analyze patient data and medical test results.
