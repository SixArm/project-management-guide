# Agile chartering

Agile chartering is a technique used in agile project management to set the direction and goals of a project. It involves bringing together a diverse group of stakeholders to collaboratively define the vision, goals, and objectives of the project. The goal is all stakeholders are aligned and working toward a shared vision.

**Key steps**:

* **Assemble a diverse group**: This can include team members, customers, end-users, business owners, and other key stakeholders.

* **Define the vision**: This includes the key problem the project is addressing, the key approach to solving the problem, and the desired outcome.

* **Set the objectives**: Create goals that will help achieve the project vision. These goals should be SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.

* **Identify risks and assumptions**: These could impact the project's success. These risks and assumptions are then evaluated and addressed as part of the project planning process.

* **Create a working agreement**: Document the rules, norms, and values that will govern the project. This agreement helps to ensure that all stakeholders are aligned and working together toward a shared goal.

Agile chartering is typically done at the beginning of a project, but it can also be done at any point during the project lifecycle to help re-align the team and stakeholders. The process is highly collaborative and helps to ensure that all stakeholders have a voice in the project and are working together toward a shared goal. By establishing clear goals and objectives and creating a shared working agreement, agile chartering helps to create a framework for success and enables the team to work more effectively together.
