# Vision, mission, values

Vision, mission, and values are three key components of a company's overall strategic plan. They represent the company's purpose, direction, and guiding principles, respectively.

* **Vision:** A company's vision is its overarching goal or aspiration. It is a statement that describes what the company hopes to achieve in the long term. A good vision statement should be inspiring, future-oriented, and succinct. It should provide a clear sense of direction and purpose for the company's employees and stakeholders.

* **Mission:** A company's mission is its reason for being. It is a statement that describes what the company does, who it serves, and how it does it. A good mission statement should be customer-focused, specific, and action-oriented. It should explain how the company adds value to its customers and what sets it apart from competitors.

* **Values:** A company's values are its guiding principles. They represent the company's beliefs and priorities, and they help to define the company's culture and behavior. A good set of values should be clear, concise, and meaningful. They should represent the company's highest aspirations and provide a framework for decision-making and behavior.

Together, a company's vision, mission, and values provide a roadmap for the company's overall strategy. They help to guide decision-making, inspire employees, and communicate the company's purpose and priorities to stakeholders. By articulating a clear and compelling vision, mission, and set of values, a company can differentiate itself from competitors and build a strong foundation for success.
