# Kanban

Kanban is a method for visualizing and managing work as it moves through a process or workflow. It was originally developed for use in manufacturing, but has since been adapted for use in software development, project management, and other fields.

The word "kanban" comes from Japanese and means "visual signal" or "card". In the original kanban system used in manufacturing, cards were used to signal when more materials were needed for a particular step in the production process. The cards were then used to track the movement of materials through the process.

In modern kanban systems, visual signals are still used, but they can take many different forms, including sticky notes, whiteboards, or digital tools. The goal is to provide a clear, real-time view of the status of work in progress, and to enable team members to collaborate and communicate more effectively.

A typical kanban board consists of several columns, representing different stages in the workflow, such as "to do", "in progress", and "done". Each item of work, represented by a card or other visual element, is moved from column to column as it progresses through the process. This provides a clear visual representation of the work that needs to be done, and helps to identify bottlenecks and areas of overload.

One of the key principles of kanban is to limit the amount of work in progress at any one time. This helps to prevent team members from becoming overwhelmed and ensures that work is completed more quickly and efficiently. Another principle is to focus on continuous improvement, with regular reviews and retrospectives to identify ways to improve the process and eliminate waste.

Kanban is often used in conjunction with other methodologies, such as Agile and Lean, and can be tailored for different teams, to improve task management, collaboration, and productivity.
