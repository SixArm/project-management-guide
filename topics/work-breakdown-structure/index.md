# Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of a project into smaller, more manageable components, such as tasks, activities, or packages. The WBS provides a structured framework for organizing and understanding the scope of work required for a project.

The WBS is a fundamental project management tool that helps in organizing, planning, executing, and controlling projects. Creating a WBS involves collaborative efforts with the project team and stakeholders. It is typically developed in iterative and participatory sessions with stakeholders.

**Key aspects:**

* **Deliverable-Oriented:** The WBS focuses on identifying and organizing the project's deliverables or outputs. Each level of the WBS represents a specific deliverable, such as a product, service, or result.

* **Scope Control:** The WBS provides a comprehensive and structured view of the project scope. It helps project managers ensure that all required work is identified and included in the project plan.

* **Task Identification and Assignment:** The WBS facilitates the identification and assignment of tasks to project team members. Each work package can be assigned to an individual or team for execution.

* **Estimation and Scheduling:** The WBS supports estimation and scheduling activities by providing a basis for accurately estimating the effort, time, and resources required for each work package.

* **Communication and Stakeholder Engagement:** The WBS serves as a visual communication tool to effectively communicate the project scope, components, resources, and workers.
