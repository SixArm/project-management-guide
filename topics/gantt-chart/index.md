# Gantt chart

A Gantt chart is a horizontal bar chart used in project management to visually represent the progress of a project over time. It is named after its creator, Henry Gantt, who introduced the charting technique in the early 1900s.

A Gantt chart displays a timeline of a project, divided into segments or tasks. The chart consists of a horizontal axis representing the duration of the project, and a vertical axis representing the individual tasks or activities. Each task is represented by a horizontal bar that spans the duration of the task. The length of the bar corresponds to the duration of the task, and its position on the timeline represents the start and end dates of the task.

Gantt charts can be used to plan and track any type of project, from small projects with a few tasks to large, complex projects with many interdependent tasks. They are particularly useful for identifying critical path tasks, which are those tasks that must be completed on time in order to keep the project on schedule.

Gantt charts are commonly used in project management software, which allows project managers to create and update the chart as the project progresses. They are also frequently used in presentations and reports to communicate project status to stakeholders and team members.
