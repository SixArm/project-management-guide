# EBFAS Organizational Climate

"EBFAS" is a German abbreviation of six elements of organizational climate: Einheit (oneness), Behendigkeit (agility), Fingerspitzengefühl (fingertip feeling), Auftragstaktik (task tactic), Schwerpunkt (main point).

Military strategist John Boyd developed EBFAS as guidance for how an organization can improve its internal climate, or culture, or ways of working. Boyd's purpose with EBFAS is to enable organization members to operate inside opponent’s OODA loops.

* **Einheit (oneness):** Means unity, or unit. This is a shared outlook possessed by a group of leaders, and represents a unifying theme that can be used to simultaneously encourage subordinate initiative yet realize superior intent.

* **Behendigkeit (agility):** Means nimbleness, quickness, swiftness. This is the ability to break out of longstanding patterns, even if they have been successful.

* **Fingerspitzengefühl (fingertip feeling):** Means intuitive flair or instinct. It describes a great situational awareness, and the ability to respond appropriately and tactfully, such as a superior ability to respond to an escalated situation.

* **Auftragstaktik (task tactic):** This is a form of military tactics where the emphasis is on the outcome of a mission rather than the specific means of achieving it.

* **Schwerpunkt (main point):** Means the center of gravity, focus of main effort, focus and direction. This is a heuristic to make decisions from tactics to strategy about priority. Everyone from leaders to supports should know the schwerpunkt i.e. know what is most important and why.
