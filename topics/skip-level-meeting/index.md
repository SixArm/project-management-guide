# Skip-level meeting

A skip-level meeting is a type of meeting in which a leader meets with employees who are not their direct reports, but rather employees from the next level down. In other words, the meeting skips a level in the chain of command.

The purpose of a skip-level meeting is to create an open and transparent communication channel between higher-level management and lower-level subordinates. The meeting can help build trust, increase employee engagement, and promote a sense of community within the organization. Skip-level meetings can also provide managers with valuable insights into the challenges faced by front-line employees, as well as ideas for improving processes and procedures.

Here are some key aspects of skip-level meetings:

* Preparation: Leaders should prepare for skip-level meetings by reviewing the work of the employees they will be meeting with, including their job descriptions, performance reviews, and any relevant metrics. They should have an agenda for the meeting, with specific topics they want to discuss.

* Focus on listening: Leaders should listen to subordinates, and gather feedback. Leaders should avoid dominating the conversation, and instead focus on listening to their subordinates' concerns, ideas, questions, and advice.

* Action: Leaders should follow up on any concerns or ideas raised during skip-level meetings. They should also communicate any changes or updates to the subordinates, to demonstrate that their feedback was taken seriously. Leaders should also follow up with the intermediate, meaning the leader's direct report who is the direct manager of the subordinate.
