# Back-office applications

Front-office applications and back-office applications are two categories of software systems used in organization.

Front-office applications focus on customer interactions and revenue generation, while back-office applications handle internal operations and administrative tasks.

Back-office application examples: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, Human Resources Information Systems (HRIS), and Supply Chain Management (SCM) systems.

Typical characteristicsâ€¦

Internal-Facing: Back-office applications are used by employees within the organization rather than by external customers.

Data Processing and Management: They handle tasks related to data processing, storage, reporting, and analysis, supporting internal operations and decision-making.

Automation and Workflow Management: Back-office applications automate repetitive tasks, streamline workflows, and improve efficiency within departments.

Security and Access Control: Due to handling sensitive information, back-office applications often incorporate robust security measures and access controls to protect data and ensure compliance.

Integration with Enterprise Systems: They integrate with other internal systems and databases, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems or payroll systems, to exchange data and streamline processes.
