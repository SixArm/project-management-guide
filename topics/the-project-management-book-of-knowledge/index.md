# The Project Management Book of Knowledge (PMBOK)

The Project Management Book of Knowledge, or PMBOK, is a widely recognized guidebook for project management published by the Project Management Institute (PMI). The PMBOK provides a framework for managing projects, including best practices, tools, and techniques.

The guidebook is organized into 10 knowledge areas, including:

* Integration management
* Scope management
* Time management
* Cost management
* Quality management
* Resource management
* Communications management
* Risk management
* Procurement management
* Stakeholder management

Each knowledge area covers a set of processes that are used to manage a project. For example, time management covers processes for developing a project schedule, monitoring project progress, and managing changes to the schedule.

The PMBOK outlines five process groups of project management:

* Initiating
* Planning
* Executing
* Monitoring and Controlling
* Closing

These process groups are used to manage projects from start to finish, with each group containing a set of processes that help guide project management activities.
