# Project Portfolio Management (PPM)

Project Portfolio Management (PPM) is a strategic approach to managing an organization's projects and aligning them with its overall business objectives. It involves the centralized management and oversight of a portfolio of projects, programs, and initiatives to optimize resource allocation, prioritize investments, and maximize business value.

**Key aspects**:

Prioritization: Assess project proposals based on strategic objectives, potential value, risks, and alignment with organizational priorities and return on investment (ROI).

Resource Management: Allocate people, budget, technology, etc. across the project portfolio. Ensure projects are adequately resourced. Optimize resource utilization.

Risk Management: Identify and manage risks associated with the project portfolio. This includes evaluating risks, implementing mitigations, and monitoring exposures.

Governance: Define roles, responsibilities, decision-making processes, and oversight mechanisms for managing the project portfolio.

Monitoring: Track the performance of projects and programs in the portfolio against predefined objectives, metrics, and key performance indicators (KPIs). Provide monitoring visibility and reports.

Optimization: Continuously evaluate and updating the project portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with the organization's strategy and goals.
