# Anomaly detection

Anomaly detection is a technique used in software to identify unusual or unexpected events, patterns, or behaviors in data. Anomalies, also known as outliers, can be caused by a variety of factors, such as errors in data collection, unexpected events, or malicious activity. Anomaly detection is used in various industries, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity, to detect and prevent fraud, cyber attacks, and other threats.

Anomaly detection algorithms can be classified into two categories: supervised and unsupervised. Supervised anomaly detection involves training a model using labeled data, where anomalies are labeled as such. The model can then be used to identify anomalies in new data. Unsupervised anomaly detection, on the other hand, does not require labeled data and involves identifying patterns that deviate from the norm.

There are various techniques used in anomaly detection, including statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning models. Statistical methods involve calculating the mean and standard deviation of a dataset and identifying any data points that fall outside of a certain range. Machine learning algorithms, such as clustering and decision trees, can be used to identify anomalies by grouping data points based on similarities or differences. Deep learning models, such as autoencoders and recurrent neural networks, can be used to detect anomalies in time-series data.

Anomaly detection can be a useful tool in identifying potential threats or issues in software systems. However, it is important to note that anomaly detection algorithms are not perfect and may produce false positives or false negatives. Therefore, it is important to use other methods, such as human analysis, to validate the results of anomaly detection.
