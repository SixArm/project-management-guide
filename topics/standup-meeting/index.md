# Standup meeting

A standup meeting, also known as a daily scrum, is a short meeting held by a team of developers, usually in the morning, to review progress, discuss challenges, and plan for the day ahead. The meeting gets its name from the fact that participants stand up during the meeting, which helps to keep the meeting short and focused.

The standup meeting typically follows a specific format. Each team member takes turns answering three questions:

* What did you work on yesterday?

* What are you planning to work on today?

* What obstacles or challenges are preventing you from making progress?

The purpose of the meeting is to keep everyone informed about what's happening with the project, identify any potential roadblocks, and provide an opportunity for team members to collaborate and support one another. The meeting should be kept brief and to the point, with each team member only taking a few minutes to share their updates.

The standup meeting is a common practice in agile software development, which emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and iterative development. It is designed to keep the team aligned and focused on the project's goals, and to encourage transparency and open communication among team members. By identifying challenges and roadblocks early on, the team can work together to find solutions and keep the project on track.

To ensure that the standup meeting is effective, it's important to establish some ground rules. For example, team members should be encouraged to speak openly and honestly, but also to be respectful and constructive in their feedback. The meeting should be kept short and focused, and team members should be encouraged to follow up with one another after the meeting if necessary.
