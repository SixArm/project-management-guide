# RACI matrix

A RACI matrix is a variation of a Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM). RACI stands for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed. A RACI matrix is used in project management to clarify the roles and responsibilities of individuals and teams. Each letter represents a different level of responsibility for tasks or decisions.

* Responsible: The person or team responsible for completing a specific task or deliverable.

* Accountable: The person who is ultimately accountable for the outcome or success of the project or process.

* Consulted: The person or team who has expertise or knowledge that is relevant to the task or decision and should be consulted before it is made.

* Informed: The person or team who needs to be informed about the task or decision, but does not have an active role in completing it.

The RACI matrix is often presented as a table with tasks or deliverables listed along one axis and team members or roles listed along the other axis. Each cell in the matrix is then filled with one or more of the RACI roles to clarify who is responsible for each task or decision.

The RACI matrix can be particularly useful in projects or processes with multiple stakeholders or where there is potential for confusion or conflict over roles and responsibilities. By explicitly defining roles and responsibilities, the RACI matrix can help ensure that everyone is clear on what they are expected to do and who is ultimately accountable for the outcome. It can also help identify areas where additional resources or support may be needed to ensure success.

A RACI matrix has a variation called a PARIS matrix. PARIS stands for Participate, Approve, Responsible, Input, Sign-off.
