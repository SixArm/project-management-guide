# Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing (FSNP)

Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing (FSNP) is a model that describes the stages of group development. It is widely used in organizational psychology to understand how teams evolve.

**Stages of group development:**

1. **Forming:** Group members get to know each other, establish the purpose and goals of the group, and determine the task at hand. At this stage, there is usually a sense of excitement and anticipation, as well as anxiety and uncertainty about the group's future.

2. **Storming:** Group members begin to voice their opinions and ideas. This can lead to conflicts. Group members may challenge the leader, question goals, and compete for power. This stage is often marked by tension and frustration, but it is an essential step in the development process.

3. **Norming:** Group members begin to develop a sense of cohesion and teamwork. They start to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses. They develop rules for interaction. They establish a sense of group identity. At this stage, the group is beginning to work effectively.

4. **Performing:** The group is fully functional. The group has established a clear identity and norms, and there is a high level of trust, cooperation, and communication among members. The group focuses on achieving objectives and delivering results.

The FSNP model is widely used, but it is not always linear: groups can go back and forth between stages, skip stages, or remain in a stage for an extended period. Additionally, different groups may experience each stage differently based on their goals, members, and context.
