# Resource leveling

Resource leveling is a project management technique that involves adjusting the project schedule to optimize the use of available resources while keeping the project on track. It involves managing and balancing the workload of project resources, such as people, equipment, and materials, so that no one is overburdened or idle.

The goal of resource leveling is to ensure that resources are used efficiently and effectively, and that the project is completed on time and within budget.

**Steps:**

* **Identify** the available resources, including people, their skill sets, availability, and working hours.

* **Develop** a resource plan that outlines how each resource will be used throughout the project.

* **Schedule** all the project activities and the resources required for each activity.

* **Assess** resource issues, such as over-allocation, under-allocation, or conflicts, that may affect the project schedule.

* **Resolve** resource conflicts: To resolve resource conflicts, project managers can adjust the project schedule by delaying activities, adding resources, or reducing scope.

* **Monitor** progress continually to ensure that the project is on track and that resources are being used efficiently.

Resource leveling is an essential technique to manage complex projects. It helps ensure that resources are used effectively and efficiently, which can help increase project success rates.
