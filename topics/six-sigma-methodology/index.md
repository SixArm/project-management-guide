# Six Sigma methodology

Six Sigma is a business management methodology that seeks to improve the quality of processes and reduce defects or errors. It was first introduced by Motorola in the 1980s and later popularized by companies like General Electric. The central idea of Six Sigma is to identify and remove the causes of defects and minimize variability in business processes. It relies on statistical analysis and measurement to identify sources of variation and eliminate them systematically.

The Six Sigma approach is based on a set of principles and practices that guide the implementation of the methodology. The five core principles of Six Sigma are:

1. Customer Focus: The customer's needs and requirements should be the driving force behind all process improvements.

2. Data and Fact-Driven Approach: Decisions should be based on objective data and facts, rather than opinions or assumptions.

3. Process Focus: All processes should be viewed as a series of interconnected steps that contribute to the final product or service.

4. Continuous Improvement: The pursuit of perfection is ongoing and should be a continuous process of improvement.

5. Empowering Employees: Employees should be empowered to make decisions and take actions that improve the quality of the process and the final product or service.

To achieve the goals of Six Sigma, the methodology follows a structured approach known as DMAIC, which stands for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. This approach is used to identify, measure, and eliminate the causes of defects in a process, as well as ensure that improvements are sustained over time.
