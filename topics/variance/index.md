# Variance

Variance is a statistical measure used to quantify the spread or dispersion of a set of data points around their mean or expected value. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.

The formula for variance is as follows:

Var(X) = (1/n) * sum((X_i - mean)^2)

where X is the set of data points, n is the number of data points, X_i is the i-th data point, mean is the mean of the data points, and sum denotes the sum of the terms inside the parentheses.

The variance is always a non-negative number, and it increases as the data points become more spread out from the mean. A low variance indicates that the data points are clustered closely around the mean, while a high variance indicates that the data points are more spread out.

Variance is commonly used in various fields such as finance, engineering, and physics, to measure the variability and uncertainty of a data set. It is also used in statistical hypothesis testing to determine the statistical significance of a result.
