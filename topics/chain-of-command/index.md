# Chain of command

A chain of command is an organization's hierarchy of authority, communication, and accountability. It establishes clear lines of communication for decision-making, and helps an organization function effectively.

**Key aspects:**

* **Hierarchy:** The chain of command establishes a clear hierarchy, outlining who reports to whom within an organization. Each employee knows who their supervisor is and who they should go to if they need to escalate an issue.

* **Authority:** Each level of management in the chain of command has a specific level of authority. This allows them to make decisions and issue orders that are binding on subordinates.

* **Communication:** The chain of command establishes clear lines of communication within an organization. Employees know to whom they report and with whom they can communicate to receive information and guidance.

* **Accountability:** The chain of command establishes each employee as responsible for their own tasks and duties, and supervisors as responsible for subordinates.

A chain of command helps to minimize confusion, streamline decision-making, and ensure that everyone works together towards shared goals. However, it is important to note that a rigid chain of command can also create problems. It can stifle creativity and innovation, and prevent employees from taking initiative and making decisions. Therefore, organizations must strike a balance between having a clear chain of command and allowing for flexibility and autonomy within the organization.
