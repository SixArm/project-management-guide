# Critical chain project management

Critical chain is a project management technique that aims to maximize efficiency by identifying and managing the critical chain of tasks in a project. The critical chain is the sequence of tasks that are dependent on one another and that, if delayed, would cause the overall project to be delayed.

The critical chain approach recognizes that traditional project management techniques may not be sufficient to ensure successful completion of a project, as they tend to focus on individual tasks rather than the entire project. Critical chain scheduling aims to address this issue by identifying the critical path and focusing resources on those tasks that are most critical to the project's success.

In critical chain scheduling, buffers are used to account for uncertainties in task durations and resource availability. These buffers are placed at strategic points in the critical chain to ensure that the project stays on track and can be completed on time.

One of the key benefits of critical chain scheduling is that it encourages a focus on the overall project goal rather than on individual tasks. By identifying and managing the critical chain, resources can be allocated more effectively, and the project can be completed more efficiently. This approach can also lead to better communication and collaboration among team members, as everyone is working toward a common goal.

However, implementing critical chain scheduling can be challenging, as it requires a significant shift in thinking and project management approach. It also requires a high level of coordination and communication among team members to ensure that the critical chain is managed effectively. Additionally, some project managers may find it difficult to estimate buffer times accurately, which can lead to scheduling delays and other issues.
