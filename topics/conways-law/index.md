# Conway's law

Conway's law is a principle in software engineering that states that the structure of a software system reflects the communication structure of the organization that produced it. It was first proposed by Melvin Conway in 1968, who stated that "organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."

In simpler terms, Conway's law suggests that the way that people communicate and work together within an organization will influence the design of the software system they create. For example, if the development team is siloed and doesn't communicate well with other teams, this may lead to a software system that is also siloed and lacks integration between its components.

Conway's law has important implications for software development teams, as it suggests that a software system should be designed to reflect the desired communication and collaboration structures of the organization. This can be achieved by creating cross-functional teams that work together closely and maintain open lines of communication throughout the development process.

In addition, Conway's law highlights the importance of organizational culture in software development. A culture that prioritizes collaboration and communication can lead to better-designed software systems that are more adaptable and easier to maintain. By contrast, a culture that is siloed or hierarchical may result in software systems that are difficult to maintain or lack coherence.

Conway's law provides a useful reminder that the structure of an organization can have a profound impact on the software systems it produces, and that it is important to consider both technical and organizational factors when designing software.
