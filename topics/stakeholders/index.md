# Stakeholders

In a business context, stakeholders are individuals and groups who have roles in the operations, decisions, and outcomes of a project or organization. These can include customers, employees, investors, suppliers, agencies, communities, and others who are impacted by the activities of the project or organization.

**Types of stakeholders:**

* **Internal stakeholders:** These are individuals or groups within the organization, such as employees, managers, and shareholders, who are directly involved in the operations and decision-making processes of the company.

* **External stakeholders:** These are individuals or groups outside of the organization who are impacted by its actions, such as customers, suppliers, investors, and the local community.

**Rankings of stakeholders:**

* **Primary stakeholders:** These are stakeholders who have a direct stake in the company, such as employees and customers.

* **Secondary stakeholders:** These are stakeholders who are indirectly impacted by the company's activities, such as the local community and government agencies.

It is important for businesses to identify and prioritize their stakeholders, as this can help them create effective communication strategies, build relationships, and manage any potential risks or conflicts. Engaging with stakeholders can also help businesses build a positive reputation and brand image, which can ultimately lead to increased customer loyalty, investor confidence, and long-term success.
