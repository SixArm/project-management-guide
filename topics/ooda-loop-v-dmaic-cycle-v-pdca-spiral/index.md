# OODA loop v DMAIC cycle v PDCA spiral

The OODA loop of military strategy, the DMAIC cycle of project management, and the PDCA spiral of iterative planning are all comparable.

* OODA: Observe, Orient, Decide, Act: a framework for how to direct one's energies to defeat an adversary. The OODA loop is a core tool used for U.S. military planning. OODA can also be useful for business strategy planing.

* DMAIC: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control: a data-driven improvement cycle for optimizing and stabilizing business processes and designs. The DMAIC improvement cycle is the core tool used to drive Six Sigma projects.

* PDCA: Plan, Do, Check, Act: a data-driven improvement cycle for iterating towards an improved system, implemented in spirals of increasing knowledge of the system that converge on the ultimate goal, each cycle closer than the previous.
