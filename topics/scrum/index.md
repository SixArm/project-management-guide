# Scrum

Scrum is a a software development framework that aims to improve productivity, reduce time to market, and promote teamwork. Scrum relies on self-organizing and cross-functional teams that work in short cycles called sprints. Scrum emphasizes continuous improvement.

**Scrum roles:**

* **Product Owner:** Define and prioritize the features of the product; build and maintain the product backlog; ensure stakeholders understand the product vision and goals.

* **Scrum Master:** Ensure Scrum is properly implemented; facilitate meetings; help the team overcome obstacles.

* **Development Team:** Design, build, and test the product.

**Scrum artifacts:**

* **Product Backlog:** A prioritized list of features, requirements, and changes that the product needs to deliver.

* **Sprint Backlog:** A list of tasks that the team has committed to completing during a sprint.

* **Increment:** A list of all the completed Product Backlog items at the end of a sprint. It must be a potentially shippable product that meets the Definition of Done.

**Scrum events:**

* **Sprint Start:** Each sprint starts with a sprint planning meeting that defines the sprint's goal and its tasks.

* **Daily:** A daily scrum meeting keeps the team members aligned, identify any obstacles, and adjust the Sprint Backlog if necessary.

* **Sprint Finish:** Each sprint finishes with a review meeting to show the work to stakeholders for feedback, and a retrospective meeting to identify areas for improvement.
