# Good Enough For Now (GEFN)

Good Enough for Now (GEFN) is a concept that describes a standard of quality or completeness that is adequate for the immediate needs of a particular situation. It is often used in software development to describe a solution that is sufficient to meet the current requirements but may require further refinement in the future.

The concept of GEFN is rooted in the idea of iterative development, which emphasizes continuous improvement through repeated cycles of planning, executing, and reviewing. In the context of software development, GEFN encourages developers to focus on delivering functional and reliable code quickly, rather than striving for perfection at every stage of the process.

GEFN is often used in agile development methodologies, where the emphasis is on delivering working software quickly and continuously iterating based on feedback. The GEFN approach allows development teams to focus on delivering the most critical features and functionality first, while leaving room for future enhancements and improvements.

While GEFN may be appropriate for certain situations, it is important to balance the need for speed and agility with the need for quality and maintainability. In some cases, a GEFN solution may lead to technical debt, which can make it more difficult and costly to maintain and improve the software over time.
