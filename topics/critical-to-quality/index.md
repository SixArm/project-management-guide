# Critical to quality (CTQ)

Critical to quality (CTQ) is a term used in Six Sigma methodology, which is a data-driven approach to process improvement. CTQ is a metric that captures customer requirements in a measurable and quantifiable way. It is used to identify areas where the organization's processes fall short of customer expectations and can be improved to achieve better customer satisfaction.

CTQs are critical features of a product or service that are essential to meeting customer expectations. They can be defined as specific measurable characteristics of a product or service that determine customer satisfaction. CTQs can be both internal (for example, manufacturing processes) and external (for example, customer requirements). They are determined by analyzing customer feedback, market research, and the organization's quality management data.

Once the CTQs are identified, the next step is to measure them, which requires establishing performance targets for each CTQ. The targets should be set in a way that ensures the CTQs are met consistently over time. The organization can then analyze the data to determine whether the CTQs are being met and identify areas where improvements can be made.

CTQs are important because they help the organization focus on the most important aspects of its products or services. By identifying and measuring the CTQs, the organization can ensure that it is meeting customer expectations and can prioritize process improvements to address areas where customer expectations are not being met. The end result is better customer satisfaction and loyalty, increased sales, and improved profitability.
