# PARIS matrix

A PARIS matrix is a variation of a Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM). PARIS stands for Participate, Approve, Responsible, Input, Sign-off. A PARIS matrix is used in project management to clarify the roles and responsibilities of individuals and teams. Each letter represents a different level of responsibility for tasks or decisions.

* Participate: The team member who is involved in the task or activity and contributes to its completion. They may have specific tasks or responsibilities related to the work, but they are not solely responsible for the task or activity.

* Approve: The team member who has the authority to approve or reject the work done on the task or activity. They review the work and ensure that it meets the required quality standards.

* Responsible: The team member who is responsible for completing the task or activity. They are responsible for completing the work and ensuring that it is done on time and to the required quality standards.

* Input: The team member who provides input and feedback on the work being done on the task or activity. They may provide advice or guidance, but they are not directly responsible for completing the work.

* Sign-off: The team member who has the authority to sign off on the completion of the task or activity. They ensure that all work has been completed to the required quality standards and that any necessary approvals have been obtained.

The PARIS matrix is a useful tool for clarifying roles and responsibilities on a project and ensuring that everyone knows what they need to do to contribute to the project's success.

The PARIS matrix should be communicated to all team members and stakeholders, reviewed regularly, and updated as needed.
