# Decision record (DR)

A decision record (DR) is a document that captures the decision-making process, the rationale behind the decision, and any associated actions or next steps. The purpose is to document and communicate decisions made within a team or organization.

A good DR provides a clear record of the decision-making process, which can be used for future reference, accountability, and transparency. DRs are often used in project management, software development, and other collaborative environments where decisions are made by multiple people.

A typical DR includes the following information: a title, a date, a context summary, a description of the decision in depth, a list of stakeholders, and advice for implmentors. DR templates can help with creating this information. DRs can use various formats, such as documents, spreadsheets, and online tools.

DRs are important to share with stakeholders to ensure eveyone is aware of the decision and any of its implications.

Some benefits of using decision records include:

* Transparency: Decision records provide transparency into the decision-making process, helping to build trust and accountability within a team or organization.

* Documentation: Decision records provide a clear and concise record of the decision, which can be used for future reference and as a historical record.

* Clarity: Decision records help to ensure that everyone involved in the decision-making process has a clear understanding of the decision, its rationale, and its implications.

* Consistency: Decision records help to ensure that similar decisions are made consistently over time, using the same criteria and decision-making process.
