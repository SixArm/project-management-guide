# Liftoff

Liftoff is a term used in agile project management to refer to the initial stage of a project, in which the team comes together to define and align on the project's goals, objectives, and initial plan. This stage is critical to the success of the project, as it sets the foundation for the entire project by creating a shared understanding of the project vision, goals, and plan.

The term "liftoff" is meant to convey the idea that the project is just getting off the ground, and that the team needs to work together to achieve lift-off and get the project moving in the right direction.

**Typical steps:**

* **Align on the project vision:** The team needs to agree on the overall vision for the project and ensure that everyone is working towards the same goal.

* **Define project objectives:** The team needs to identify the specific objectives that the project needs to achieve in order to realize the vision.

* **Identify project stakeholders:** The team needs to identify all the stakeholders who will be affected by the project and determine their needs and expectations.

* **Create a high-level plan:** The team needs to create a high-level plan that outlines the key milestones, deliverables, and activities that will be required to achieve the project objectives.

* **Establish project governance:** The team needs to establish the processes and procedures that will be used to manage the project, including roles and responsibilities, decision-making processes, and communication protocols.

The liftoff process is typically facilitated by a project manager, who guides the team through activities and ensures that everyone is aligned and engaged. The liftoff process helps to ensure that the project is set up for success from the start.
