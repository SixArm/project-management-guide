# The Spotify Model

The Spotify Model is a popular approach to organizing software development teams, named after the company that first implemented it. It is based on the idea of cross-functional teams, autonomy, and continuous learning.

The model's main components:

* Squads: Squads are cross-functional teams that work together to deliver specific business objectives or features. Each squad is made up of 6-12 people, including developers, designers, and product owners. They are self-organizing and have a high degree of autonomy to make decisions about how they work, what technologies they use, and how they deliver value to customers. The squad's work is based on agile principles and it has a backlog of work items that it prioritizes and delivers in short cycles.

* Tribes: Tribes are groups of 50-150 people that are organized around a particular product, technology, or business area. Tribes are also self-organizing and have a high degree of autonomy. They are responsible for defining the roadmap, strategy, and direction of the product or business area they are focused on.

* Chapters: Chapters are groups of people who share a similar skill set, such as developers, designers, or testers. They are organized across different squads and tribes, and provide a community for members to share knowledge, best practices, and support each other. Chapters are responsible for career development and growth, and provide a forum for feedback and coaching.

* Guilds: Guilds are informal groups of people who share a common interest or passion, such as front-end development or user experience. They are open to anyone in the organization, and provide a platform for learning, sharing knowledge, and networking. Guilds are self-organizing and run by volunteers.
