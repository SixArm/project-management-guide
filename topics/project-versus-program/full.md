# Project versus program

Projects and programs (a.k.a. programmes) are terms that both relate to initiatives within an organization. They differ in terms of scope, complexity, and objectives.

A project is a temporary endeavor with a defined set of objectives, deliverables, and a specific timeline. It is typically a discrete effort undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. Projects have clear start and end dates, well-defined tasks and activities, and a dedicated project team. They are aimed at achieving specific goals within a defined scope, budget, and timeline.

Key characteristics of projects include:

* Specific Objective: Projects are focused on achieving a particular outcome or delivering a specific output.

* Defined Scope: Projects have well-defined boundaries and a clear scope of work.

* Temporary Nature: Projects have a finite duration, with a defined start and end date.

* Cross-Functional Teams: Projects often involve a team of individuals with diverse skills and expertise who come together to achieve project objectives.

* Unique Deliverables: Projects create something new or unique, such as a product, system, or process.

A program is a group of related projects and activities that are managed collectively to achieve a broader set of organizational objectives. Programs are strategically aligned initiatives that require coordination and integration of multiple projects to realize benefits and synergies that may not be achievable through individual projects alone.

Key characteristics of programs include:

* Strategic Alignment: Programs are aligned with the organization's strategic goals and objectives.

* Multiple Projects: Programs consist of multiple interrelated projects that contribute to a common goal.

* Benefits Realization: Programs are focused on achieving benefits that extend beyond the outcomes of individual projects.

* Program Management: Programs have a dedicated program manager who oversees the coordination, integration, and alignment of projects within the program.

* Complex Dependencies: Programs involve managing dependencies and interrelationships among projects, ensuring they are effectively coordinated and synchronized.

* Long-Term Focus: Programs are often long-term initiatives that extend beyond the duration of individual projects.

In summary, while projects are discrete efforts aimed at achieving specific objectives within a defined scope, programs encompass multiple projects that work together to achieve broader organizational goals and benefits. Projects are often managed individually, while programs require a more strategic and integrated approach to ensure successful delivery and realization of benefits. Effective portfolio management involves understanding the distinctions between projects and programs and making informed decisions about resource allocation, prioritization, and overall strategic alignment.
