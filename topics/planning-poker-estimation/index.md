# Planning poker estimation

Planning poker is an agile estimation and planning technique used to determine the relative size of user stories or features in software development projects. It is a collaborative method that involves the entire team, including developers, product owners, and project managers, to come up with a common understanding of the complexity and effort required to complete a feature or story.

Planning poker is played by a team in a meeting or workshop setting. The team is presented with a list of user stories or features, and each member of the team is given a set of cards with each card representing a range of effort. For example, some teams like to use cards with time estimate ballparks (Hours, Days, Weeks), or t-shirt sizes (Small, Medium, Large), or numbers in the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21).

The team then selects a user story or feature to estimate and each member of the team privately selects a card to represent the effort required to complete the feature. The cards are then revealed simultaneously and the estimates are discussed, allowing team members to justify their estimates and to identify any discrepancies.

The process is repeated until the team reaches consensus on the estimate for the user story or feature. The final estimate is usually based on the median or mode of the selected cards, although other methods can also be used.

Planning poker helps the team to avoid anchoring bias and groupthink, and encourages open communication and collaboration among team members. It also enables the team to identify potential risks, dependencies, and technical challenges associated with a user story or feature, which can inform the prioritization of the product backlog.
