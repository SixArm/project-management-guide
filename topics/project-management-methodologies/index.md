# Project management methodologies

Project management methodologies are structured approaches or frameworks that provide guidelines and best practices for managing projects. These methodologies offer a set of processes, tools, and techniques to initiate, plan, execute, control, and close projects.

Some widely recognized project management methodologiesâ€¦

Waterfall Methodology: This follows a sequential, linear approach to project management. It consists of distinct phases such as requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase is completed before moving on to the next.

Agile Methodology: Agile methodologies, including Scrum, Kanban, and Lean, are iterative and flexible approaches. They emphasize collaboration with users, adaptive planning, and continual delivery of end-user value.

Lean: Lean project management is derived from lean manufacturing principles and aims to eliminate waste, increase value, and optimize processes. It emphasizes the efficient use of resources, reducing non-value-added activities, and continuous improvement.

Prince2 (Projects in Controlled Environments): Prince2 is a process-based methodology widely used in the United Kingdom and internationally. It provides a structured approach to project management, focusing on defined roles and responsibilities, formal documentation, and controlled project stages. Prince2 offers clear governance, risk management, and a focus on business justification.

PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge): PMBOK is a comprehensive standard published by the Project Management Institute (PMI). It outlines a set of best practices, knowledge areas, and processes that cover the entire project management lifecycle.
