# Command and control (C2)

Command and control (C2) is a management approach or style that involves centralized decision-making, hierarchical structures, and a top-down flow of authority and communication. In a command and control environment, decision-making power resides at the top of the hierarchy, and instructions are passed down to lower levels for implementation.

Command and control can be effective in certain contexts, such as emergency situations or military operations where quick decision-making and clear directives are necessary. However, it has been criticized in more dynamic and complex environments where agility, creativity, and employee empowerment are valued.

**Key aspects**:

Centralized decision-making: Decision-making authority is concentrated at the top levels of the organization, with managers and leaders making decisions that are then communicated downward.

Hierarchical structure: The organization typically has a clear chain of command, with well-defined roles and responsibilities for each level. Decision-making authority decreases as you move down.

Direct supervision: Managers closely monitor and control the work of subordinates, often providing specific instructions on how tasks should be performed.

Formal communication channels: Communication flows primarily through formal channels, such as memos, reports, and official meetings. Information may be restricted to certain levels.

Emphasis on compliance and obedience: Employees are expected to follow instructions and adhere to established rules and procedures without questioning or challenging authority.
