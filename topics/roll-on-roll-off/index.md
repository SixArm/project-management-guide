# Roll-on Roll-off (RoRo)

In the context of project management, "Roll-On Roll-Off" (RoRo) refers to a project execution strategy where resources or deliverables are added or removed from a project at specific intervals or stages. The term is derived from the transportation industry, where it describes a method of loading and unloading cargo from ships using ramps.

**Key aspects:**

* **Resource Allocation:** RoRo allows for the allocation of resources to a project in a phased manner. Resources, such as personnel or equipment, can be added or removed as needed at different stages of the project. This helps optimize resource utilization.

* **Deliverable Phasing:** RoRo can be applied when a project involves the delivery of work in increments or phases. Instead of delivering the entire scope of work at once, the project is divided into manageable portions or stages. This allows for the incremental completion and review of deliverables.

* **Flexibility:** RoRo provides flexibility in project execution by allowing adjustments to resources and deliverables based on changing project requirements. It enables project teams to adapt to evolving needs, address risks and issues, and make necessary course corrections.

* **Risk Mitigation:** RoRo can help mitigate project risks by breaking down complex projects into smaller, more manageable phases. By delivering work incrementally, it allows for early identification and mitigation of risks, as well as the opportunity to adjust project plans and strategies based on real-time feedback.

* **Integration and Collaboration:** RoRo encourages continuous integration and collaboration among project team members. The incremental delivery of work facilitates regular communication, coordination, and feedback loops between different stakeholders, ensuring alignment and shared understanding of project progress.
