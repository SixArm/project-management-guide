# Inception

Inception is a term used in project management to describe the initial phase of a project. It is also known as project initiation. The inception sets the tone for the entire project and provides the foundation for all future project activities.

During inception, the project team works to define the scope of the project, identify the key stakeholders, establish the project goals and objectives, and create a high-level project plan. The team also works to identify any potential risks, dependencies, and constraints.

The inception phase typically involves several key activities, including:

* Project Definition: This involves defining the project scope, objectives, and goals. It is important to have a clear understanding of what the project will deliver and what it will not deliver.

* Stakeholder Analysis: Identifying the key stakeholders involved in the project and understanding their needs and expectations is critical to ensuring the success of the project.

* Risk Management: Identifying potential risks and developing a plan to mitigate those risks is essential to reducing the impact of risks on the project.

* Feasibility Analysis: Evaluating the feasibility of the project in terms of budget, resources, and schedule is important to determine whether the project is viable.

* High-Level Planning: Creating a high-level project plan that outlines the key milestones, deliverables, and resources required.

The inception phase typically ends with the development of a project charter that outlines the key project objectives, scope, and assumptions. The project charter serves as a roadmap for the project and provides a clear direction for the project team. Once the inception phase is complete, the project can move into the planning phase.
