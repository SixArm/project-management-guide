# Enterprise Portfolio Project Management (EPPM)

Enterprise Portfolio Project Management (EPPM) is a methodology that helps organizations manage their project portfolios in a more efficient and strategic manner. EPPM focuses on aligning projects with the organization's goals and objectives, and ensuring that resources are allocated appropriately to achieve those goals.

**Typical steps:**

* **Project identification and prioritization:** Identify all potential projects, and evaluate them based on strategic fit, potential ROI, and other relevant factors.

* **Resource allocation:** Allocate resources to the prioritized projects in a manner that maximizes ROI and strategic alignment.

* **Risk management:** Identify and manage risks associated with individual projects, as well as with the total portfolio.

* **Performance tracking:** Track and report on the performance of individual projects and the total portfolio. This allows stakeholders to monitor progress and make informed decisions.

* **Continuous improvement:** Gather feedback from stakeholders, to refine the portfolio management approach and improve project outcomes over time.

EPPM is particularly useful for large organizations with complex project portfolios. By taking a more strategic approach to portfolio management, EPPM helps organizations make better use of their resources and achieve their strategic objectives more efficiently.
