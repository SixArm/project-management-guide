# Move fast and break things

"Move fast and break things" is a phrase coined by Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook. The idea behind this phrase is that companies should prioritize speed and innovation over avoiding mistakes or failures. This approach encourages a willingness to take risks and experiment, with the understanding that not every idea will be successful.

The concept is often associated with the culture of Silicon Valley startups, where the focus is on disrupting established industries and creating new markets through the rapid development and deployment of new technologies. The idea is that by moving quickly and being willing to fail, companies can learn from their mistakes and improve their products or services over time.

However, the approach has also been criticized for its potential negative impact on users and society, as well as for encouraging a culture of reckless behavior and disregard for the consequences of actions. Critics argue that companies have a responsibility to consider the potential impact of their products and services on society, and that the "move fast and break things" mentality can lead to unintended consequences that can be difficult to reverse.

In recent years, the phrase has fallen out of favor as companies have become more aware of the need to balance innovation with responsible business practices. Many companies have shifted towards a more deliberate and measured approach to product development, with a focus on user safety, privacy, and long-term sustainability.
