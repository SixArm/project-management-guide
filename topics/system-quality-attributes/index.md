# System quality attributes

System quality attributes refer to the characteristics of software or hardware that determine overall quality. The attributes are critical to ensuring the system meets user expectations and performs as intended.

**Examples:**

* **Usability:** Usability refers to the system's ease of use and the degree to which it meets user needs and expectations. A usable system is one that is intuitive, easy to navigate, and provides users with a positive experience.

* **Reliability:** Reliability refers to the system's ability to perform as intended under normal conditions and in the face of unexpected events. A reliable system is one that is available and responsive when users need it and can recover quickly from failures or errors.

* **Scalability:** Scalability refers to the system's ability to handle growth in the number of users, transactions, or data volumes. A scalable system is one that can adapt to changes in demand without experiencing a decline in performance.

* **Maintainability:** Maintainability refers to the system's ability to be easily updated, modified, and maintained over time. A maintainable system is one that can be easily adapted to changing user needs, business requirements, and technological advancements.

* **Compatibility:** Compatibility refers to the system's ability to work with other systems, hardware, and software applications. A compatible system is one that can integrate with other systems and operate seamlessly in a larger ecosystem.

Explicit system quality attributes enable organizations to prioritize work, allocate resources, and create better products.
