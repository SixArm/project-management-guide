# Constraint satisfaction

Constraint satisfaction is a technique used in artificial intelligence (AI) and operations research to solve problems by finding a set of values that satisfy a set of constraints. The idea behind constraint satisfaction is to express a problem as a set of variables that can take on different values, along with a set of constraints that define the relationships between those variables. The goal is to find a set of values for the variables that satisfies all of the constraints.

Constraints can be thought of as rules that restrict the values that can be assigned to variables. For example, in a scheduling problem, a constraint might be that two events cannot be scheduled at the same time. In a logistics problem, a constraint might be that the weight of a shipment cannot exceed a certain limit. Constraints can also be more complex, involving logical or arithmetic expressions that must be satisfied.

Constraint satisfaction problems can be found in many different areas, including scheduling, planning, and optimization. Some examples of constraint satisfaction problems include scheduling classes so that there are no conflicts, assigning tasks to workers so that each worker has a balanced workload, and optimizing the placement of components on a circuit board.

Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are a class of problems that can be represented as a set of variables and constraints. The goal is to find a valid assignment of values to the variables that satisfies all of the constraints. CSPs can be solved using a variety of algorithms, including backtracking, forward checking, and constraint propagation.
