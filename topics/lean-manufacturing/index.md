# Lean manufacturing

Lean manufacturing, often referred to as simply "Lean," is a production philosophy and methodology aimed at maximizing value for customers while minimizing waste and inefficiencies in the manufacturing process. It originated from the Toyota Production System (TPS) and has been widely adopted by companies across various industries.

**Key aspects**:

Value: Lean manufacturing starts by defining value from the customer's perspective. Value is determined by what the customer is willing to pay for in a product or service.

Value Stream Mapping: Value stream mapping is a visual tool used in Lean manufacturing to identify and analyze the steps and activities involved in the production process, to help optimize them.

Flow: Lean manufacturing emphasizes streamlining the flow of work throughout the production process. This involves minimizing delays, interruptions, and unnecessary movement of materials or people.

Pull System: Production is just-in-time based on actual customer demand, not based on forecasts. This helps avoid overproduction and reduces inventory holding costs.

Waste Reduction: Waste, or "Muda" in Lean terminology, refers to any activity or process that does not add value to the customer. Examples are overprocessing, defects, delays, and underutilization.

Continuous Improvement: Lean manufacturing promotes "Kaizen", a culture of continuous improvement. All employees to actively seek opportunities for improvement and participate in problem-solving.

Respect for People: Lean manufacturing emphasizes the importance of respecting and empowering people at all levels of the organization. It encourages teamwork, engagement, and upskilling.
