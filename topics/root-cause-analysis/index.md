# Root cause analysis (RCA)

Root cause analysis (RCA) is a problem-solving technique used to identify the underlying causes of an event, rather than just treating symptoms. RCA aims to prevent similar problems from happening in the future. RCA is widely used in engineering, manufacturing, healthcare, software development, and business management.

**Steps:**

1. **Identify the problem:** Define the problem that needs to be solved. This includes understanding the symptoms of the problem, the impact it has on the system, and the timeline of events that led to the problem.

2. **Gather data:** Collect relevant data. This may include observing the problem in action, reviewing documents and records, and interviewing stakeholders.

3. **Analyze data:** Determine the causes and effects of the problem. This may involve creating a timeline of events, using cause-and-effect diagrams, and conducting statistical analysis.

4. **Identify the cause:** The root cause is the underlying reason why the problem occurred. It is the factor or factors that, if removed or changed, would prevent the problem from occurring in the future.

5. **Develop a plan:** Once the root cause has been identified, create a corrective action plan to eliminate the root cause, to prevent similar problems from occurring in the future.

6. **Implement the plan:** This may involve changes to policies and procedures, training programs, equipment modifications, or other measures.

RCA can be used to address a wide range of problems, from minor issues to major disasters. Identifying the root cause of a problem enables teams to implement targeted solutions, rather than just treating symptoms.
