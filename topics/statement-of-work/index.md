# Statement of Work (SOW)

A Statement of Work (SOW) is a document that outlines the scope of work to be performed in a project or service contract. It is a critical component of project planning and helps establish clear expectations for both the client and the service provider. The SOW typically includes the projectâ€™s goals, objectives, deliverables, timeline, and costs.

The SOW begins with an introduction that provides an overview of the project and the purpose of the SOW. It then includes a detailed description of the work to be performed, including the objectives, tasks, and deliverables. This section should be as specific as possible and provide clear and measurable goals to ensure that everyone involved in the project has a clear understanding of what is expected.

The SOW also includes a timeline for the project, including start and end dates, milestones, and deadlines. This timeline helps to ensure that the project stays on track and that all parties involved are aware of key dates and deadlines.

In addition, the SOW includes a section on the resources required to complete the project. This may include personnel, equipment, and materials, as well as any other resources that are necessary for successful project completion. The SOW also outlines any assumptions or limitations that may affect the project, such as budget constraints or technological limitations.

Finally, the SOW includes a section on costs, outlining the budget for the project and any payment terms or conditions. This section is critical to ensure that both the client and the service provider are in agreement on the costs associated with the project.
