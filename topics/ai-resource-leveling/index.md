# AI resource leveling

Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help resource leveling, which is the process of efficiently allocating resources among tasks or projects.

**Examples:**

* **Demand Forecasting:** Analyze historical data, project requirements, task dependencies, skill requirements, and other relevant factors to predict future resource demand.

* **Optimal Allocation:** Consider constraints, objectives, workloads, bottlenecks, capabilities, and costs.

* **Skill Matching:** Analyze peoples' skills, capabilities, expertise, experience, certifications, and the like, to match them with specific requirements of tasks or projects.

* **Real-Time Adjustments:** Continuously monitor resource utilization and project progress, to show where resources are underutilized or overburdened and suggest adjustments.

* **Impact Assessment:** Simulate different resource allocation scenarios and evaluate their impact on project schedules, costs, and overall performance.

* **Resource Constraints:** Consider limits and preferences such as resource availability, working hours, vacation schedules, and preferred assignments.

* **Data Integration:** Combine data from sources, such as project management tools, HR systems, and resource databases, to gain a comprehensive understanding of capacity.

* **Continuous Improvement:** Learn from past experiences and outcomes, improving the algorithms and recommendations over time, and adapt to changing dynamics.
