# Functional specifications

Functional specifications are documents that describe the functional requirements of a software system or product. They outline what the system or product should do and how it should behave, in terms of its features, functionality, and user interactions.

Functional specifications typically include:

* Detailed descriptions of the user interface, often including user stories, use cases, mockups, or wireframes.

* Inputs and outputs, often including example data.

* Technical specifications, such as for any required data structures, algorithms, certifications, licenses, and the like.

* Guidelines for how to handle errors, exceptions, and other unforeseen events.

Functional specifications are typically created by business analysts or software architects, in collaboration with the development team, project managers, and stakeholders. The specifications must be clear, concise, and easily understood by all parties involved in the software development process.

Functional specifications are an important part of the project planning process because they provide a clear and detailed roadmap for the development team to follow. They help ensure that all stakeholders have a common understanding of the system or product requirements, which can help to prevent misunderstandings and miscommunications. Additionally, they can serve as a basis for quality assurance testing and other project management activities.
