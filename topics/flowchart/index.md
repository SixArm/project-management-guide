# Flowchart

A flowchart is a graphical representation of a process, system, or workflow. It uses various symbols and arrows to depict the sequence of steps or actions involved in a process, illustrating how information or materials flow from one step to another.

Flowcharts are widely used in various fields, including business, engineering, programming, and project management, to visually represent complex processes and facilitate understanding.

**Key components:**

* **Start/End:** The flowchart begins with a rounded rectangle or oval shape representing the starting point or end point of the process. It indicates where the process begins or ends.

* **Process Step:** Rectangles or squares represent individual process steps or actions. Each step describes a specific action or task that occurs within the process.

* **Decision:** Diamond-shaped symbols represent decision points or branches in the process flow. They typically contain a question or condition and have arrows pointing to different paths based on the outcome of the decision.

* **Connector:** Small circles or dots are used to connect different parts of the flowchart. They indicate where the flow continues from one part of the chart to another, often to avoid cluttering the diagram.

* **Arrow:** Arrows connect the symbols and indicate the flow of the process. They show the direction of the process from one step to another, indicating the sequence of actions.

* **Input/Output:** Parallelograms represent input or output points in the process. They denote where data or information enters or leaves the process.
