# Functional specifications - steps

Creating a functional specification involves steps:

1. Gather requirements from the stakeholders or end-users. This involves identifying the features and functionality required in the software system.

2. Define the scope. This sets realistic expectations and avoids scope creep, which can cause delays and cost overruns.

3. Create a list of functional requirements and non-functional requirements that the software system must satisfy. This list should be detailed and cover all aspects of the system.

4. Organize the requirements into categories to make it easier to understand the system's overall structure and flow.

5. Develop use cases that describe how a user interacts with the software system. Use cases help to define the input, processing, and output of the system. They can also help test the system's functionality.

6. Define acceptance criteria that the software system must meet to be considered acceptable. These criteria should be specific and measurable, and should be defined in a way that can be tested.

7. Write the functional specifications in a clear and concise manner. These should include details such as the input, processing, and output of the system, as well as any constraints or assumptions.

8. Review and revise: Once the functional specifications are written, review them with stakeholders and subject matter experts to ensure that they accurately reflect the system. Make any revisions before development process begins.

9. Validate the functional specifications to ensure that the software system meets the requirements and works as intended. This is typically done through testing and user feedback.
