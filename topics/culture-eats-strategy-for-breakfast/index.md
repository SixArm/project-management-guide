# Culture eats strategy for breakfast

"Culture eats strategy for breakfast" is a famous quote attributed to Peter Drucker, a renowned management consultant and author. The quote means that organizational culture is a more powerful force than strategy when it comes to achieving success. In other words, no matter how well-crafted a strategy may be, it will not be successful if it is not supported by a strong and aligned organizational culture.

Organizational culture refers to the shared values, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that characterize an organization. It includes things like the way people communicate, the way decisions are made, the way people are rewarded and recognized, and the level of collaboration and teamwork within the organization. Culture can have a significant impact on employee engagement, productivity, and overall performance, and it can also play a role in attracting and retaining top talent.

On the other hand, strategy refers to the plan of action that an organization develops to achieve its goals. It includes things like market analysis, competitive positioning, and resource allocation. A well-crafted strategy can be a critical factor in achieving success, but it must be supported by an organizational culture that is aligned with the strategy.

The phrase is a reminder that even the best strategy will not be successful if it is not supported by a strong organizational culture. It means that organizations need to pay attention to their culture, and ensure that it is aligned with their strategy. This can involve things like fostering a culture of innovation and risk-taking, developing a strong sense of purpose and mission, and creating a culture of transparency, collaboration, and accountability.
