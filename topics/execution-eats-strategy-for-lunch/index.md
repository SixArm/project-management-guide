# Execution eats strategy for lunch

"Execution eats strategy for lunch" is a popular business saying that emphasizes the importance of execution and implementation in achieving success, even more so than having a great strategy. The quote is often attributed to Peter Drucker, although there is no record of him actually saying it.

In essence, the saying suggests that having a great strategy is important, but it's not enough. In order to succeed, you also need to have the ability to execute that strategy effectively. This means having a strong focus on getting things done, being agile and adaptable, and being able to respond quickly to changes in the market or other external factors.

Successful execution requires a combination of factors, including having the right people, processes, and tools in place. It also involves being able to prioritize effectively, communicate clearly, and manage resources efficiently.

The saying is often used to encourage organizations to focus more on execution, and to remind them that strategy alone is not enough to achieve success. By emphasizing the importance of execution, the quote encourages businesses to be more proactive, nimble, and adaptable, and to focus on delivering results rather than simply having a good plan.
