# Intent plan

An intent plan is a document that describes a person's or organization's intentions or goals for a particular project, task, or initiative. It is a roadmap that guides decision-making and helps align everyone involved.

Here are some key aspects of intent plans:

* Purpose: The purpose of an intent plan is to provide a clear and concise outline of the goals, objectives, and desired outcomes of a project or initiative. It helps to ensure that everyone involved in the project understands what is expected of them and what they are working towards.

* Components: An intent plan typically includes several key components, including a description of the project, the objectives or goals, the expected outcomes, the timeline, the resources required, and the roles and responsibilities of team members.

* Clarity: Clear communication is crucial when creating an intent plan. The objectives, goals, and expected outcomes should be specific and measurable, and the timeline should be realistic and achievable. This helps to ensure that everyone involved in the project understands what is expected of them and what they are working towards.

* Flexibility: While an intent plan provides a roadmap for a project, it is important to recognize that things may change along the way. As such, an intent plan should be flexible enough to allow for adjustments as necessary. This helps to ensure that the project remains on track and that the desired outcomes are achieved.

* Communication: Communication is key when it comes to an intent plan. It is important to regularly communicate progress and updates to team members and stakeholders. This helps to ensure that everyone involved in the project is informed and can make informed decisions.
