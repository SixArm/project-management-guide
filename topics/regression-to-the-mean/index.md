# Regression to the mean

Regression to the mean is a statistical phenomenon that occurs when an extreme value or performance on a given variable is followed by a less extreme value or performance on the same variable. It is based on the concept that most things that are measured will fluctuate over time, and extreme measurements or performances are often followed by measurements or performances that are closer to the average or mean.

In regression to the mean, extreme values tend to be outliers that are not representative of the typical values of a variable. For example, if a sports player has an exceptional performance in one game, it is unlikely that they will perform at the same level in the following game. Instead, their performance will regress towards their average or mean performance over time.

Regression to the mean can occur in a variety of situations, such as in sports, healthcare, education, and finance. It is important to consider this phenomenon when interpreting data or making decisions based on observations, as it can lead to incorrect conclusions if not properly accounted for.

To mitigate the effects of regression to the mean, it is important to collect data over a long period of time and analyze trends rather than focusing on isolated data points. Additionally, it is important to use statistical methods such as regression analysis to account for the effects of regression to the mean and to make more accurate predictions based on the available data.
