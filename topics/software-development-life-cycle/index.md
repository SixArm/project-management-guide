# Software development life cycle (SDLC)

The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a process used by software development teams to create software applications. The SLDC follows a set of steps that ensure the final software product is efficient, reliable, and meets the users’ requirements:

* Planning: The planning phase is where the development team defines the scope of the project, the goals and objectives of the software, and the resources needed to complete the project. This stage is crucial in determining the feasibility of the project.

* Requirements Gathering and Analysis: During this stage, the development team identifies the functional and non-functional requirements of the software. This stage involves interviews, surveys, and research to identify what the users need and want from the software.

* Design: The design phase involves creating a detailed plan for the software’s structure and features. The design should include information on the software’s functionality, user interface, data storage, security, and other important details.

* Implementation: The implementation stage is where the actual coding of the software occurs. The software developers use the design documents to write the code and create the software.

* Testing: The testing phase is where the software is tested to ensure that it functions as expected. This stage can involve both automated and manual testing.

* Deployment: The deployment stage involves deploying the software to the end-users. This stage can involve training, documentation, and support.

* Maintenance: The maintenance phase is where the software is continually updated and maintained to ensure that it continues to meet the users’ needs. This can involve bug fixes, feature enhancements, and security updates.
