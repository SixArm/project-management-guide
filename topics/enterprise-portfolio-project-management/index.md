# Enterprise Portfolio Project Management (EPPM)

Enterprise Portfolio Project Management (EPPM) is a methodology that helps organizations manage their project portfolios in a more efficient and strategic manner. EPPM focuses on aligning projects with the organization's goals and objectives, and ensuring that resources are allocated appropriately to achieve those goals.

EPPM typically includes the following steps:

* Project identification and prioritization: EPPM identifies all potential projects, and evaluates them based on strategic fit, potential ROI, and other relevant factors.

* Resource allocation: EPPM allocates resources to the prioritized projects in a manner that maximizes ROI and strategic alignment. This may involve reallocation from low-priority projects to high-priority ones.

* Risk management: EPPM identifies and manages risks associated with individual projects, as well as with the total portfolio.

* Performance tracking and reporting: EPPM tracks and reports on the performance of individual projects and the total portfolio. This allows stakeholders to monitor progress and make informed decisions.

* Continuous improvement: EPPM involves a continuous improvement process, where feedback from stakeholders is used to refine the portfolio management approach and improve project outcomes over time.

EPPM is particularly useful for large organizations with complex project portfolios. By taking a more strategic approach to portfolio management, EPPM helps organizations make better use of their resources and achieve their strategic objectives more efficiently.
