# Project charter

A project charter is a formal document that outlines the purpose, scope, objectives, and stakeholders of a project. It is a foundational document that provides a framework for project planning, execution, and monitoring. The project charter is created during the early stages of the project, usually during the initiation phase, and is approved by the project sponsor and other key stakeholders.

The project charter includes several key components, which are as follows:

* Purpose: Describe the reason for initiating the project, its benefits and how it aligns with the organization's strategic goals.

* Scope: Detail the boundaries of the project, and what is included and excluded.

* Objectives: Define the desired outcomes of the project in specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and timely terms.

* Deliverables: The deliverables are the tangible products or services that the project will produce.

* Stakeholders: Define the individuals, groups, and organizations that are impacted by or can impact the project.

* Assumptions: Detail factors that are taken for granted and not validated.

* Risks: List potential events or circumstances that could negatively impact the project.

* Budget: Estimate the cost of the project.

* Schedule: Show the timeline for completing milestones.

The project charter is a guiding document for the project team and stakeholders, and should be updated as new information becomes available.
