# Software development life cycle (SDLC)

The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a process used by software development teams to create software applications. SLDC phases ensure the final software product is efficient, reliable, and meets users’ requirements.

**Phases:**

* **Planning:** Define the scope of the project, the goals and objectives, and the resources needed to complete the project. This stage is crucial in determining the feasibility of the project.

* **Requirements Gathering and Analysis:** Identify the functional and non-functional requirements of the software. This stage involves interviews, surveys, and research to identify what the users need and want from the software.

* **Design:** Create a detailed plan for the software’s structure and features. The design should include information on the software’s functionality, user interface, data storage, security, and other important details.

* **Implementation:** Use the design documents to write the code and create the software.

* **Testing:** Ensure the software functions as expected. This stage can involve both automated and manual testing.

* **Deployment:** Deploy the software to the end-users. This stage can involve training, documentation, and support.

* **Maintenance:** Update and maintain the software, to ensure that it continues to meet the users’ needs. This can involve bug fixes, feature enhancements, and security updates.
