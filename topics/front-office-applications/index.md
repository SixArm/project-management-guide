# Front-office applications

Front-office applications and back-office applications are two categories of software systems used in organization. Front-office applications focus on customer interactions and revenue generation; back-office applications handle internal operations and administrative tasks.

Front-office application examples include Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, Point-of-Sale (POS) systems, and E-commerce platforms.
