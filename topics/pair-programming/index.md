# Pair programming

Pair programming is a software development technique where two programmers work together on the same computer to solve a coding problem. The two programmers are known as the driver and the navigator. The driver is responsible for writing the code, while the navigator reviews and guides the driver. They work together to design, write, test and debug code.

Pair programming has several benefits. Firstly, it allows for greater collaboration and communication between team members. This leads to better understanding of the code and helps in catching errors early on. Additionally, it encourages knowledge sharing and helps junior team members learn from their more experienced colleagues.

Pair programming also leads to higher code quality, as two sets of eyes are reviewing the code in real-time. This often results in better-designed code that is easier to maintain and debug. Additionally, it can help to reduce the amount of time spent on bug fixing and testing.

There are several different ways to implement pair programming. One common approach is to have one computer with two keyboards and two monitors. Both programmers sit side by side and switch roles regularly. Another approach is remote pair programming, where two programmers work together from different locations, using video conferencing software and remote desktop sharing.
