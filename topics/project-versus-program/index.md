# Project versus program

Projects and programs (a.k.a. programmes) are terms that both relate to initiatives within an organization. They differ in terms of scope, complexity, and objectives.

A project is a temporary endeavor with a defined set of objectives, deliverables, and a specific timeline. It is typically a discrete effort undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. Projects have clear start and end dates, well-defined tasks and activities, and a dedicated project team. They are aimed at achieving specific goals within a defined scope, budget, and timeline.

A program is a group of related projects and activities that are managed collectively to achieve a broader set of organizational objectives. A program is a strategically-aligned initiative that requires coordination and integration of multiple projects to realize benefits and synergies that may not be achievable through individual projects alone. Programs typically have a dedicated program manager who oversees the coordination, integration, and alignment of projects within the program, and whose objectives are long-term, extending beyond the duration of individual projects.
