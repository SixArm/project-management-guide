# Organizational chart

An organizational chart, or org chart for short, is a visual representation of a company's structure and hierarchy. It shows the relationships between the different positions and departments within an organization, as well as the reporting relationships between employees.

An org chart typically displays the company's top-level executives at the top of the chart, with each subsequent level of management and staff shown below them. The chart may also show the company's various departments or business units, with each department being shown in a separate section of the chart.

Org charts can be useful for a variety of purposes. They can help employees understand their roles and responsibilities within the organization, and they can help managers identify potential areas of overlap or gaps in responsibility. They can also be useful for planning purposes, such as when a company is considering a reorganization or restructuring.

There are different types of org charts that can be used depending on the organization's structure and needs. A hierarchical org chart is the most common type, and it shows a clear chain of command with each level of management and staff reporting to the level above them. A matrix org chart, on the other hand, shows the relationships between employees who work on different projects or in different departments, and it may not have a clear chain of command.

Org charts can be created using a variety of software tools, such as Microsoft PowerPoint or Visio, or specialized org chart software. They can be displayed on a company's intranet or on printed materials, such as employee handbooks or training manuals.
