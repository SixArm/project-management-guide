# Cynefin framework

The Cynefin framework is a sense-making tool for organizational management and strategic planning. It helps leaders recognize the nature of the problems they are facing and choose approaches for addressing them. Cynefin encourages adaptive thinking, helps navigate complexity, and emphasizes the need to probe, sense, and respond.

The term "Cynefin" is pronounced kuh-NEV-inn, from the Welsh language. It means "habitat" or "place of belonging".

The Cynefin framework categorizes situations into five domains:

1. Simple Domain: Cause-and-effect relationships are clear and predictable. Solutions and best practices can be easily identified and applied. This domain is for known knowns.

2. Complicated Domain: Problems are not immediately obvious but can be solved through analysis, research, expertise, and specialized knowledge. Multiple approaches and solutions may exist. This domain is for known unknowns.

3. Complex Domain: Cause-and-effect relationships are not easily discernible. They are characterized by uncertainty and unpredictability. Multiple factors interact and influence outcomes. Experimentation, adaptive approaches, and sense-making are necessary. This domain is for unknown unknowns.

4. Chaotic Domain: Cause-and-effect relationships are unclear, or missing, or volatile. Quick decision-making and quick action is necessary to establish order. This domain is for crises.

5. Disorder Domain: This is a transitional state, where it is unclear which of the other domains is applicable or how to make sense of the situation. Further exploration is necessary to categorize the problem. This domain is for flux.
